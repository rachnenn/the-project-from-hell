Horray for the project!

The PriorityQ class had a bug with its isEmpty() method; that has been fixed.

Let me know when the main class, input reading code, and input file are done.  I've finished and tested the MST with a small sample size of n = 7 and it works.  I'm ready to add the MST code.

Just added the Driver class, from my testing it should parse the input files correctly. If you wouldn't mind running your algo on it that would be very helpful as mine is not complete enough yet to test the adjacency list to my satisfaction.
